Hi, I’m Cosmin.

I work at the intersection of analytics, automation, and applied machine learning, with experience delivering data-driven systems in real-world, client-facing contexts.

My background spans psychology, healthcare research, and IT, which has shaped a practical approach to working with messy data, ambiguous requirements, and non-technical stakeholders.

On this profile you’ll find projects involving:
- Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- Applied machine learning (clustering, regression, classification)
- Automation-driven data generation and reporting
- Dashboards and lightweight data applications
- Experimentation with cloud-hosted analytics workflows

Most projects here are learning-by-building: focused on understanding problems, structuring data, and producing usable outputs rather than purely theoretical models.
