Hello, I'm Cosmin

Originally a Psychologist, I'm passionate about better understanding human behaviour, as well as various other phenomena, at a MACRO level. 
For this purpose, I am using the tools of data science to:

    - deliver high quality statistical investigations of these phenomena; 
    
    - create friendly result disseminations using visualisations and data storytelling;  
    
    - leverage Machine Learning techniques to create actionable predictions.
